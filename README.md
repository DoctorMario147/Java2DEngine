# Java2DEngine
Simple game engine made using Java.

This engine is capable of:
 - Drawing images to the screen
 - Automatically removing certain colours from images to allow for transparency
 - Handling keyboard and mouse input
 - Includes a basic game loop to allow for simple games to be created

In the future, I plan to make it capable of:
 - Built-in collision detection
 - Gamepad input
 - Audio handling and playing
 - Light rendering
